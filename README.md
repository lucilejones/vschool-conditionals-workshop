# if/else example
In this example, imagine we're writing a weather app that displays a message based on the current temperature. We'll have output for if there's no temperatue reading, if it's too hot, too cold, or if the weather is perfect. 

We can also put the if/else block into a function that we can call with different arguments.

And we can update our if/else checks to add specific conditions.

# ternary example
In the first ternary example, we can think of building a simple chat app where users can see each other's status as online or offline. We want to display the correct status based on whether the user is connected to the chat server or not.

This is written first as an if/else statement, and then we convert it into a ternary statement.
